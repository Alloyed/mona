reddit mona lisa meme thing in c.

written by nick welch <nick@incise.org>.  author disclaims copyright.

dependencies (for debian-based systems):
	
	apt-get install build-essential pkgconfig libcairo2-dev libsdl2-dev

As far as I know, those things run just about everywhere, so porting to
OSX/Windows should just be a matter of installing those things and running the
makefile.
to run:

    make
    ./mona -h for options
    Control-C in terminal to quit

WARNING to those who might scrutinize the code:

the code is REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY messy and ugly and bad.  i started off
with some old code and frantically pulverized it into what it is.  the result
is a mix of c and c++, different syntax styles, etc.  it's horrible.  i was in
a rush, only had a few hours to do it, and needed to get to sleep to wake up
for a flight the next day.  now it works and i have little motivation to go
back and clean up something that was basically a random whim.  it's not
impossible to understand or anything, but it's not pretty either.

also, one drawback vs. the web version is that you can't see the random
attempts onscreen -- you only see the current "best" version.
